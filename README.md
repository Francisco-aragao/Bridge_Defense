# Bridge_Defense

This work was developed for the discipline of computer networks with the objective of recreating the game "Bridge Defense" using network communications, in the client-server format. Thus, game information such as bridges, rivers, and ship positions are received from the server, and the developed client needs to coordinate the shots to sink as many ships as possible. 

The objective of the work is to use network communication with sockets, in addition to dealing with different requests, packet losses and parallelism in the sending of data.
